===========
This is my personal website! I use Github mainly because my website is hosted statically. 

I make heavy use of Materialize.css; please do check out their work. :)

### Current Version of site : v1.0 (Live)

##Changelog

- v1.0
  - Started keeping track of my changes on the READme, for good habit.
  - Also keeping track of what I'm doing with my own projects.
  - Project pages are mostly fleshed out. Still missing some screenshots.
  - Added some subdomains for fun. Still learning that.
  - Cleaned up my own repository, it's dirty!

Improvements for v1.1:
  * Add the screenshots, make them expandable
  * Finish up controls and executables for each game project
  * Add Project Loki, if possible. (2012 project, still fun)
  * Begin working on my Hearthstone Venting app, keep track of that.
  * Add my work experience/workshop stuff in the work/experience section
  * Working on a "schedule.jasonthechiu.com" subdomain which I can link with a Firebase, which will display my tasks/things to do at real time.
