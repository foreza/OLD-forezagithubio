This is my personal website! I use Github pages for now.

I make heavy use of Materialize.css; please do check out their work. :)

### Current Version of site : v2.0 (Live)

##Changelog



-v2.2
  - Reverted a commit which affected both master and development branch. Whoops. Won't do that again.
  - Made several renames to make the website more professional.
  - Had to redo the index html change.
  - Added about page and initial formatting/placeholders.


Todo:
  - Remake projects page entirely so it's just one long page.
  - Add search bar to search my own website (maybe)
  - Change images on main page to a uniform size + update them.
  - Finish up about page / add links and content.


- v2.1
  - Added more helpful comments to the index.
  - Cleared up on of the sections, and reduced overall vanity (who cares about coffee lover? seriously.)
  - Made an about page that mirrors the index.

Todo:
  - Still fix project pages/deal with hosting/fix images
  - Construct the about page based off of prior content from both work/projects page.
  - Less is good.

- v2.0
  - Added better SEO (search engine optimization) to my site.
  - Actually went and understood what it actually does.
  - Now following visitors/traffic with google sites.
  - Updating info on the site and renaming things and sorting folders to clean it up.
  - Updated with latest resume version
  - Removing redundant files, updating my home image.
  - Site now greets you when you first enter. All hail the toast!

Backlog/To-do list:
  - Fix project pages (make a new format)
  - Thinking about moving this site off of github pages and onto an AWS server to allow for PHP and other fun things.
  - Make all project images uniform size (my eyes hurt, make it stop.)
  - Add more projects and compile their builds.
  - Fix page structure, I don't like having projects/work/clubs as a main page...

- v1.0
  - Started keeping track of my changes on the READme, for good habit.
  - Also keeping track of what I'm doing with my own projects.
  - Project pages are mostly fleshed out. Still missing some screenshots.
  - Added some subdomains for fun. Still learning that.
  - Cleaned up my own repository, it's dirty!

Improvements for v1.1:
  * Add the screenshots, make them expandable
  * Finish up controls and executables for each game project
  * Add Project Loki, if possible. (2012 project, still fun)
  * Begin working on my Hearthstone Venting app, keep track of that.
  * Add my work experience/workshop stuff in the work/experience section
  * Working on a "schedule.jasonthechiu.com" subdomain which I can link with a Firebase, which will display my tasks/things to do at real time.
